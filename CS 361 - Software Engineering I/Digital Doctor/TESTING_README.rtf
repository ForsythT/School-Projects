\f0\fs24 \cf0 To get server running, \
1. upload "Website" folder to your flip account\
2. shell into flip server of your choice (examples below are for flip2)\
3. navigate to directory in which "Website" is located (e.g. ~/CS361/Website)\
4. run command "./node_modules/forever/bin/forever start -o out.log serverScript.js"\
5. If you wish to stop the server, run command "./node_modules/forever/bin/forever stopall"\
6. Note that an out.log file is created, which contains the console.log output. I'd recommend\
	running the command "tail -f out.log" in a separate terminal to easily see the output\
